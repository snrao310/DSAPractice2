/*
 Before we proceed to complete solution, let us first talk about all base cases.

Let the two arrays be A[N] and B[M]. In the following explanation, it is assumed that N is smaller than or equal to M.

Base cases:
The smaller array has only one element
Case 0: N = 0, M = 2
Case 1: N = 1, M = 1.
Case 2: N = 1, M is odd
Case 3: N = 1, M is even
The smaller array has only two elements
Case 4: N = 2, M = 2
Case 5: N = 2, M is odd
Case 6: N = 2, M is even

Case 0: There are no elements in first array, return median of second array. If second array is also empty, return -1.

Case 1: There is only one element in both arrays, so output the average of A[0] and B[0].

Case 2: N = 1, M is odd
Let B[5] = {5, 10, 12, 15, 20}
First find the middle element of B[], which is 12 for above array. There are following 4 sub-cases.
…2.1 If A[0] is smaller than 10, the median is average of 10 and 12.
…2.2 If A[0] lies between 10 and 12, the median is average of A[0] and 12.
…2.3 If A[0] lies between 12 and 15, the median is average of 12 and A[0].
…2.4 If A[0] is greater than 15, the median is average of 12 and 15.
In all the sub-cases, we find that 12 is fixed. So, we need to find the median of B[ M / 2 – 1 ], B[ M / 2 + 1], A[ 0 ]
and take its average with B[ M / 2 ].

Case 3: N = 1, M is even
Let B[4] = {5, 10, 12, 15}
First find the middle items in B[], which are 10 and 12 in above example. There are following 3 sub-cases.
…3.1 If A[0] is smaller than 10, the median is 10.
…3.2 If A[0] lies between 10 and 12, the median is A[0].
…3.3 If A[0] is greater than 12, the median is 12.
So, in this case, find the median of three elements B[ M / 2 – 1 ], B[ M / 2] and A[ 0 ].

Case 4: N = 2, M = 2
There are four elements in total. So we find the median of 4 elements.

Case 5: N = 2, M is odd
Let B[5] = {5, 10, 12, 15, 20}
The median is given by median of following three elements: B[M/2], max(A[0], B[M/2 – 1]), min(A[1], B[M/2 + 1]).

Case 6: N = 2, M is even
Let B[4] = {5, 10, 12, 15}
The median is given by median of following four elements: B[M/2], B[M/2 – 1], max(A[0], B[M/2 – 2]), min(A[1], B[M/2 + 1])

Remaining Cases:
Once we have handled the above base cases, following is the remaining process.
1) Find the middle item of A[] and middle item of B[].
…..1.1) If the middle item of A[] is greater than middle item of B[], ignore the last half of A[], let length of ignored
part is idx. Also, cut down B[] by idx from the start.
…..1.2) else, ignore the first half of A[], let length of ignored part is idx. Also, cut down B[] by idx from the last.
